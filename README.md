# Helper Functions for OpenCV

Some helper functions used across most of my OpenCV exercises, and a helper application for
saving jpg's from a video file.

## Getting Started

Copy files to your local system, run make using file Makefile.1. Install libgregOpenCvHelp.so somewhere that it will be found. 
To run the helper application launch it with name of video file to read. Note that jpg's will be saved
in the same directory as the video file, not the directory that you run the program from.
Tested under Ubuntu 18.04, gcc 7.4.0, OpenCV 3.4.4.

### Prerequisites

gcc, OpenCV 3
